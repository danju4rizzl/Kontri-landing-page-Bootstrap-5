Hey guy! If you are coding along with us -

### Setup the project

- [Download](https://github.com/danju4rizzl/Kontri-landing-page-Bootstrap-5/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the zip or clone the repo.
- Then open the `starter.html` file in your code editor.
- Finally lunch your local server using the [vscode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) by Ritwick Dey.

Happy coding!
